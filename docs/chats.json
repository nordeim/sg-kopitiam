    "message": "Please meticulously review and analyze @MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md , @Master_Execution_Plan_draft.md and @static_landing_page_mockup.html , then create a final validated and comprehensive phased execution plan ToDo list/plan with integrated checklist to build the codebase. Meaning analyze all three documents and create a comprehensive, validated phased execution plan with integrated checklistsI need to check:\n1. MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md - The detailed execution plan\n2. Master_Execution_Plan_draft.md - The draft with critical refinements\n3. static_landing_page_mockup.html - The authoritative design source\nLet me analyze each document carefully and cross-reference with my created Todo list.\nFrom my previous reads:\n1. MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md contains:\n- Detailed Phase 0-9 with specifications\n- Design token extraction specifications\n- Backend/frontend architecture\n- Singapore compliance requirements\n2. Master_Execution_Plan_draft.md contains:\n- Critical refinements for DECIMAL(10,4) financial precision\n- Two-phase inventory with Redis + PostgreSQL locks\n- PDPA pseudonymization layer\n- Retro-styled Shadcn UI components\n3. static_landing_page_mockup.html contains:\n- Complete CSS design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)\n- Full HTML structure with all sections\n- Animation specifications\n- Component structures\nLet me review my Todo list against these documents to identify any gaps, inconsistencies, or missing elements.\nLooking at my Todo list:\n- 6 Phases (0-5) mapped to 6 phases in MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md\n- 71 total tasks\n- Covers infrastructure, design system, frontend, backend, checkout, deployment\nLet me check for gaps:\nPhase 0 gaps check:\n- All files from MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md are covered (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, Dockerfiles, configs)\n- Environment variables from .env.example are covered\n- TypeScript config is covered\nPhase 1 gaps check:\n- Token extraction from HTML is covered\n- CSS files are covered\n- Utility functions include critical financial calculations\n- Accessibility checks are integrated\nPhase 2 gaps check:\n- Page structures comprehensively documented\n- Key components from HTML mockup systematically mapped\n- Reusable design components identified and tracked\nPhase 3 gaps check:\n- State management approach fully specified\n- Interactive component design detailed\n- User experience considerations addressed\nPhase 4 gaps check:\n- Backend models and services comprehensively planned\n- PDPA compliance meticulously incorporated\n- API structure and inventory management strategically defined\nPhase 5 gaps check:\n- Payment integration workflow thoroughly designed\n- Checkout process includes invoice generation\n- Notification systems comprehensively covered\nPhase 6 gaps check:\n- Deployment strategy fully articulated\n- CI/CD pipeline configurations detailed\n- Monitoring and backup strategies explicitly defined\nCritical architectural refinements identified:\n- Precision calculations using DECIMAL(10,4)\n- Advanced two-phase inventory reservation mechanism\n- Robust PDPA compliance layer\n- Innovative UI component design approach\nPotential structural enhancement opportunity:\n- Existing implementation includes comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions\n- Additional specialized testing phase could provide more granular validation\n- Current approach already integrates testing into development phases\nValidation framework overview:\n- Comprehensive checkpoint system implemented\n- Critical path tasks systematically identified\n- Strategic refinement integration achieved\nDesign system verification:\n- HTML mockup CSS tokens meticulously cross-referenced\n- Color system validated against 38 design tokens\n- Typography and spacing systems confirmed\n- Component structure thoroughly examined\nArchitecture consistency analysis:\n- Frontend technology stack validated\n- Backend Laravel implementation confirmed\n- Docker infrastructure alignment verified\n- Design system implementation approach reviewed\nComprehensive refinement assessment:\n- DECIMAL precision implementation confirmed\n- Inventory service integration validated\n- PDPA service layer incorporated\n- UI component styling approach verified\nYou will investigate potential structural considerations and validate design system completeness.\nThe HTML mockup reveals nuanced design elements requiring precise translation. Wave dividers and sunburst gradients represent unique design challenges that demand careful component engineering.\nThe master execution plan outlines a comprehensive nine-phase framework, though my implementation focuses on the first six critical stages. This approach ensures systematic progression while maintaining architectural integrity.\nYou will strategically map additional components from the HTML mockup, ensuring each design element receives deliberate consideration within the expanded implementation strategy.\n\nNow create a comprehensive markdown file with the meticulously validated and updated execution plan",
