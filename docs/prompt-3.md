Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work. Now, please meticulously review the codebase files to align your understanding of the current state of the project and the actual implemention. Then meticulously create a briefing document for an AI coding agent to be able to continue from the present state. After conducting your meticulous codebase review to align your understanding of the codebase, you will create a comprehensive *single-source-of-truth* briefing document for any coding agent or human developer to have the same deep understanding of the project and the current codebase status. Save the agent *briefing document* that captures your aligned and validated understanding as a markdown file `AGENT.md`.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously plan and create the detailed comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` with file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their description, mermaid diagrams to show the application flowcharts and the database schema. Review and validate the PAD against the project planning documents and the actual codebase. Finally, create a detailed and comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` in the project root folder, as the single source-of-truth handbook to fully initialize new developer or another coding agent to be able to handle new PRs independently.

Create the comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` in the root folder.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. The dynamic landing page @frontend/dynamic_landing_page.html shown in the browser is ugly and looks like a skeleton design, no where near the static HTML mock-up @static_landing_page_mockup.html . Now, please meticulous review and analyze @frontend/dynamic_landing_page.html and then compare it with @static_landing_page_mockup.html to identify the root cause of the deviation. Then meticulously plan and create a remediation plan to fix the UI/UX visual discrepancy issue. Review and validate your remediation plan before proceeding to execute it meticulously.
