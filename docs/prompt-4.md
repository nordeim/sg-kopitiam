Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. The build was successful and I started the dev server and captured new dynamic page screenshots below. The dynamic landing page is now very bloated, likely due to duplicate HTML codes, also javascripts are not active and CSS is not properly working. Please meticulously review and analyze the following dynamic and static HTML file and the related browser screenshots. Then meticulously plan and create a remediation plan to fix the UI/UX visual discrepancy issue. Review and validate your remediation plan before proceeding to execute it meticulously. 

# Dynamic landing page @landing_page.html is very minimal with the following browser screenshots:
